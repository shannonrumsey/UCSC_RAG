When Coverage Begins and Ends | UC Santa Cruz

What you need to know
Registered students who are automatically enrolled in UC SHIP are covered while attending classes, during term breaks, and through the summer â€” up until the end of the day before the next fall term begins.
Non-registered and eligible dependents who enroll in UC SHIP are covered from the first day of the enrolled term until the start of the following term. For continued coverage, eligible dependents must reenroll each term.
Periods of coverage
Coverage periods align with academic term dates.
Extending coverage after graduating
After graduating, your coverage continues until the end of the day before the next academic term begins. If you graduate during the spring term, your coverage continues through the summer until the day before the start of the next fall term.
You can purchase UC SHIP coverage for one additional term if you were enrolled in UC SHIP during the coverage period in which you completed your degree and you purchase coverage within 30 days from the date your coverage ends.
To purchase additional coverage, complete the enrollment form before the next term (additional coverage period) begins.
