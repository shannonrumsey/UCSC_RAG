Extending Coverage After Graduation | UC Santa Cruz

After graduating, your coverage continues until the day before the next academic term begins. If you graduate during the spring term, your coverage continues through the summer until the day before the start of the next fall term.
You can purchase UC SHIP coverage for one additional term if you were enrolled in UC SHIP during the coverage period in which you completed your degree and you purchase coverage within 30 days from the date your coverage ends.
To purchase additional coverage, email the enrollment formÂ to Academic HealthPlans (AHP) or call (855) 427-3167 before the next term (additional coverage period) begins.
