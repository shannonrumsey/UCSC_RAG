Enrolling in Coverage | UC Santa Cruz

What you need to know
You are automatically enrolled in UC SHIP coverage, unless you are approved to waive coverage. If you’re a non-registered student, you can enroll in UC SHIP only during voluntary enrollment periods that typically begin 30 days before — and end 30 days after — the start of the coverage period. Enrollment outside these periods will not be accepted, unless they’re the result of a qualifying life event.

When you can enroll
The UC SHIP periods of coverage align with the year’s academic terms.
Non-registered students can enroll in UC SHIP only during the voluntary enrollment period, which begins 30 days before the start of the coverage period and ends 30 days after the start date of the coverage period.
Example: If the winter coverage period begins Jan. 1, then enrollment for the winter term will start on Dec. 2 and end on Jan. 31.
You cannot enroll outside of the enrollment period, unless you have a qualifying life event.

Celebrating your 26th birthday this year?If you’re covered on a parent’s medical plan, you’ll no longer qualify for coverage when you turn 26. Learn how to enroll in UC SHIP below.
Enrolling after a qualifying life event
You and/or your eligible dependents can enroll in UC SHIP during the coverage period if you experience one of the following qualifying life events:
Involuntary loss of other health insurance coverage
Turn 26 and lose coverage as a dependent on a parent’s plan
Marriage or divorce
Birth or adoption of a child
Declaration or termination of a domestic partnership
When you have a qualifying life event during the coverage period, you must notify the insurance office on your campus within 31 days of losing your coverage and provide an official written letter of termination from your previous health insurance carrier.
You will be enrolled in UC SHIP as of the date of your involuntary loss of other coverage if you notify the insurance office within 31 days of losing your coverage. If you miss that window, your UC SHIP coverage will be effective on the date you pay the full UC SHIP premium.
To enroll yourself and your eligible dependents in UC SHIP after a qualifying life event, email Academic HealthPlans and provide proof of the qualifying life event.
To begin the enrollment process, complete the Qualifying Event (QE) form with the information needed.
Note: Premiums are not prorated for any enrollment occurring after the start of a coverage period, except premiums for newborns added as a dependent.
