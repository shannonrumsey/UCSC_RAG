Help paying for medical expenses
Providing affordable health care is a UC SHIP mandate. Even so, every student’s financial position is unique. If your out-of-pocket medical expenses are causing you financial hardship, these UCSC resources may be able to provide financial assistance:

Charity care may also be an option for you. Reach out to the provider’s office and ask if they offer any form of charity care. Although some providers do not offer any sort of charity care, others do. They may provide an application for you to complete or ask you to write a letter. Providers who do offer charity care will review your request, and then they could offer to write off the full amount you owe, a portion of that amount, or they may determine you don’t meet their qualifications for charity care.
