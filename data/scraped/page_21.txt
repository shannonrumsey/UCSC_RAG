What you need to know
If you are covered by UC SHIP, you need a referral from the Student Health Center (SHC) to get care anywhere else — except for emergency room care, urgent care clinic visits, pediatric care, obstetrics services, gynecological care, and LiveHealth Online virtual visits.
If needed, the SHC will provide a referral for services it can’t provide.

What you pay for care
You’ll pay nothing for preventive care at the SHC, and low copays for other services and procedures.
Except for preventive care, you will pay a deductible for services you receive outside the SHC or the UC network of doctors and facilities, unless otherwise noted. After you meet the deductible, the plan will pay a portion of the cost. What you pay for medical costs counts toward your combined medical and pharmacy annual out-of-pocket limit. Once your costs reach that limit, UC SHIP will pay 100% of your medical and pharmacy costs for the remainder of the year.
If you receive any care from an out-of-network provider, you will be responsible for your coinsurance plus any amount above the maximum allowable charges. You’ll always pay more when you receive care from providers who are not part of the UC SHIP or Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer PPO networks.
Based on where you receive care, here’s what you can expect to pay for typical health care services.
Note: Office visit copays do not include what you’ll pay for other services, such as lab work and X-rays. For coverage details, including expenses and services the plan does not cover, see the UC Santa Cruz Benefit Booklet [PDF].
