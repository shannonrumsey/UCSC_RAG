Dialog Policy
For a nice overview, see related work section of Joshi 2024.
Joshi et al 2024 - LLM-Based Open-Domain Integrated Task and Knowledge Assistants with Programmable Policies (Has a great overview)
Dialog Acts
A dialog act, also known as a speech act, is the “action” an utterance performs, such as request information, confirm, etc.
Dialog Act Tagging
Dialog Acts are related to RST, except that dialog acts assume that the relation expressed in the dialog act is between adjacent utterances. See here for more information.
Switchboard Dialog Act Draft 1997
2005 - Guidelines for Dialogue Act and Addressee Annotation Version 1.0 Guidelines for the AMI dataset
Yu & Yu 2019 - MIDAS, A Dialog Act Annotation Scheme for Open-Domain Human-Machine Spoken Conversations There used to be a corpus and an open-source system available, but it has been taken down. Jurik uses this tagger in his system

Dialog Agent Safety
Safety: making sure the dialog agent doesn't use swear words, offensive language, give bad advice, etc, which could happen if the agent has been trained on a corpus of dialogs.

Ideas for future work
Use dialog to add training data to improve the NER and EL on the fly. As examples get corrected, add them in.  There should be prior work on this.
