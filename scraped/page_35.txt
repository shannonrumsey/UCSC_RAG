NLP 267 Machine Translation

Machine Translation systems can instantly translate between any pair of over eighty human languages such as German to English or French to Russian. Modern translation systems learn to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text. This course covers the models and algorithms used by such systems and explains how they are able to automatically translate one human language to another. The course covers fundamental building blocks using concepts from linguistics, statistical and deep machine learning, algorithms, and data structures. It provides insight into the challenges associated with machine translation and introduces novel approaches that might lead to better machine translation systems.
Credits 5

Requirements
Prerequisite(s): NLP 201 and NLP 243 or CSE 244B. Concurrent or previous enrollment in NLP 202. Enrollment is restricted to natural language processing graduate students and computer science and engineering Ph.D. students, or by permission of the instructor.
NLP 270 Linguistic Models of Syntax and Semantics for Computer Scientists

Provides an introduction to theoretical linguistics for natural language processing, focusing on morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, and on training students in linguistic description, representation, and argumentation. Students learn to describe common features underlying natural languages and to manipulate several syntactic and semantic representations.
Credits 5

Requirements
Enrollment is restricted to natural language processing graduate students and computer science and engineering Ph.D. students, or by permission of instructor.
