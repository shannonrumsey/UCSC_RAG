Bridle et al 1982 - An Algorithm for Connected Word Recognition pdf (UCSC only) Cited by Ney 1992 for beam search
Ney et al. 1992 - Data Driven Search Organization for Continuous Speech Recognition in the SPICOS System pdf (UCSC only) See p. 4 bottom for a history of beam search, which it says is called “beam search, DP beam search, or pruned DP search.”

Overviews

Parsing
Carbonell 1979 - Towards a Self-Extending Parser
Sampson 1986 - A stochastic approach to parsing Learns statistical rules from a manually annotated corpus. Uses simulated annealing to find the most probable parse. (Randomized inference, similar to later work in NLP in 2014 here) “We have built up a database of manually-parsed sentences, from which we extract statistics that allow a likelihood measure to be determined for any logically possible non-leaf constituent of a parse-tree. That is, given a pairing of a mother-label with a sequence of daughter-labels, say the pair <J, NN JJ P>, the likelihood function will return a figure for the relative frequency with which (in this case) an adjective phrase consists of singular common noun + adjective + prepositional phrase.” “The most direct way… would be to generate all possible tree-structures for a given sentence taken as a sequence of word-tags, and all possible labellings of each of those structures, and choose the tree whose overall plausibility figure is highest. Unlike in the case of word-tagging, however, for parsing this approach is wholly impractical… I have therefore begun to experiment with simulated annealing as a solution to the problem.”
