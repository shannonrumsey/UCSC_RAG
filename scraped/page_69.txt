Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting
Adjust the batch size, or use gradient accumulation (see this blog, for example) to simulate larger batch sizes
Try a different optimizer, such as RAdam
Adjust epsilon in Adam
Fine-tuning Specific Tricks
NoisyTune: A Little Noise Can Help You Finetune Pretrained Language Models Better : Before fine-tuning, adding a very small amount of uniform noise to each weight matrix can help performance (noise scaled by variance of the weight)
