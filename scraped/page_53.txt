Creating Pages
To create a page, just visit it, and go to “Create page.”  (This will only work if you have an account and are logged in.)
Namespaces
You can create namespaces (basically folders) by putting “namespace:” at the beginning of the title.  The Sitemap is organized by namespaces.  Namespaces can be nested.  There are namespaces such as “nlp”, “ml”, and “papers”.  The “paper” namespace is for paper summaries.  Feel free to create your own namespace such as “username” for your own pages.
