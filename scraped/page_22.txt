What you need to know
Your UC SHIP coverage includes both inpatient and outpatient care for mental health and substance use. As with some other services, for your care to be covered by UC SHIP, you need a referral to see a provider outside the Student Health Center, except for LiveHealth Online.
Covered services and resources
Within the UC SHIP network, you have access to mental health and substance use services through the Student Health Center, LiveHealth Online, and the Anthem Blue Cross network.
For details about inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use services covered by UC SHIP, review the UC Santa Cruz Benefit Booklet [PDF].

LiveHealth Online
When you’re overwhelmed by stress, depression, anxiety, lack of focus, or other issues, you can see a therapist virtually, wherever you are, through LiveHealth Online. Your session will last 45 minutes, and you can set up a return visit with the same or a different provider if you want to.
Take the following steps to schedule a visit:
Sign up or log in to LiveHealth Online.
On the top navigation bar, choose Therapy.
Select your therapist and schedule a visit.
You’ll pay nothing to see a therapist via LiveHealth Online. For more information, see the LiveHealth Online flyer.
