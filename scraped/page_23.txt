Prescription Drugs | UC Santa Cruz

What you need to know
When you need a prescription filled, your most convenient option will be the SHC Pharmacy, where your copay will typically be the lowest.
Optum Rx administers your pharmacy benefit, so when you’re away from campus and need a prescription filled, you’ll usually pay less when you use a retail pharmacy in the Optum Rx nationwide retail pharmacy network versus an out-of-network pharmacy.
If you have your prescription filled at a pharmacy outside the SHC Pharmacy, be sure you show your Anthem member ID card.
How your prescription drug coverage works
What you pay for your prescription (your copay) is based on medication type: generic, brand-name formulary, brand-name non-formulary, or specialty. The formulary [PDF] is the list of medications that UC SHIP covers.
What you pay for prescription drug costs counts toward your combined medical and pharmacy annual out-of-pocket limit. Once your costs reach that limit, UC SHIP will pay 100% of your pharmacy costs.
Oral contraceptives are freeYou’ll pay nothing for FDA-approved generic oral contraceptives and brand-name oral contraceptives (when there’s no generic equivalent). Coverage is for a 180-day supply.
You’ll find coverage details below. For more information, review the UC Santa Cruz Prescription Drug Plan booklet [PDF].
Your annual limit on out-of-pocket costs includes your prescription drug copays and medical costs.

Out-of-network pharmacies
When you fill your prescription at an out-of-network pharmacy, you will pay the entire amount of the prescription and then submit the online Optum Rx prescription drug claim form for reimbursement. You can also download a PDF of the Optum Rx prescription drug claim form [PDF]. The pharmacist must complete and sign the claim form to ensure the claim is properly processed. Your reimbursement could be less than what you paid for the medication.
