I am an Assistant Professor in the Jack Baskin School of
Engineering at UC Santa
Cruz.
My research lies in the areas of natural language processing, structured
prediction, and deep learning. My work focuses on enabling computers to
understand and generate natural language better (semantic parsing and
generation) and to help people who speak different languages communicate
(machine translation).
My collaborators and I developed JAMR,
which is a semantic parser, generator and aligner for the Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR).
I gave a tutorial at NAACL
2015 on AMR with
Nathan Schneider and Tim
Oâ€™Gorman
(slides).
