Our Masters program at UCSC balances theory with practice including a 15 unit Capstone project to enable you to apply the skills you’ve acquired on the program to a real-world issue or challenge. You’ll gain valuable employability skills and practical experience both from working in a team with your peers and from the insights you’ll gain from your academic or organizational mentor(s). Recent student teams have collaborated with experts from industry giants like Bloomberg, IBM, Interactions, LinkedIn, Microsoft and others to address industry-relevant and research-focused topics in the NLP field. The Capstone project is a great way for you to scope out the NLP field, looking at projects that interest you and identifying organizations that you may wish to work with in future. Working closely with your mentor during the project you’ll extend your networks and gain practical employability skills that will support your future job search. Many organizations value their involvement in the Capstone projects as this can be a useful way to informally evaluate students’ skills and find a good fit for workplace vacancies. The NLP Capstone experience offers a great opportunity to extend your networks and put yourself in front of potential employers. Registration is open to the professional NLP community and invitations are sent to a range of interested parties who are able to attend either in person or remotely. Since our program launched in 2020 our NLP students have collaborated with industry partners at Adobe, Amazon, Bloomberg, CDIAL, IBM, Intel, Interactions, Google, LinkedIn, Meta, Microsoft, ModelCode and UCSC.
