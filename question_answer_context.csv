Is there anything related to Geography that I could study as a grad student?,"
Yes, there are several options for Geography-related graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz. The Department of Geography offers a range of graduate degree programs, including Master of Arts (M.A.) and Ph.D. programs. Some of the specific programs include: 

* M.A. in Environmental Studies
* M.A. in Geography
* M.A. in Environmental Science
* M.A. in Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
* M.A. in Geography and Environmental Studies
* M.A. in Geographical Information Systems and GIS
* Ph.D. in Geography

These programs are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and methods of geography, as well as the ability to apply them to real-world problems. The Department of Geography also offers several interdisciplinary programs that combine geography with other fields, such as environmental science, sociology, and economics.

In addition to these graduate degree programs, UC Santa Cruz also offers several undergraduate degree programs in geography, including a B.A. and a B.S. in geography. These programs provide students with a solid foundation in the principles and methods of geography, as well as the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of study.

If you are interested in studying geography-related graduate programs, I recommend visiting the Department of Geography website and contacting their graduate program coordinator to learn more about the specific programs and requirements.","Graduate Programs
