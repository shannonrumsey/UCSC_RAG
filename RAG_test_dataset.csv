Note: early Russian papers use M instead of E to denote expectation.
History: As far as I can tell, SGD as we know it was first introduced by Ermol'ev & Nekrylova 1966, and stochastic sub-gradient descent (SSGD) was introduced by Ermol'ev 1969. These works built upon the stochastic approximation method that was proposed in Robins & Monroe 1951. This was extended to maximization problems of one dimension in Kiefer & Wolfowitz 1952, which was extended to the multidimensional case in Blum 1954 and Blum 1958. However, these methods used a finite-difference approximation to computing the stochastic gradient, in contrast to Ermol'ev & Nekrylova 1966 (History from Ermol'ev  1966 Sec 12).
Ermol'ev  1966 - Methods of solution of nonlinear extremal problems pdf See section 12 for the early history of SGD. Overview of Blum 1954 shows that it is not quite SGD (computes a finite-differences approx to SGD).
Ermol'ev & Nekrylova  1966 - Some methods of stochastic optimization pdf Stochastic gradient descent for differentiable, convex functions. $\xi^{(s)}$ is the stochastic gradient, $\rho_s$ is the stepsize. Cited by Nekrylova 1974. I believe this is the introduction of SGD, since Blum 1954 uses a finite-differences method.

Calls sub-gradients “generalized gradient vectors,” and calls the stochastic sub-gradient a “generalized stochastic gradient vector, or briefly, the stochastic quasi-gradient vector.” Assumes convexity, since assumes sub-gradient. Cited by Nurminskii 1974 and Guseva 1971.

(Have to look closer, I'm not sure if it's actually SGD). Assumes convexity. Notes: g(x) is the subgradient of f(x), called reference function. It is called the support functional in Polyak 1967 (citation [7]).

Give me a paper published on fine-tuning in 2024.,NLP Wiki,"What is fine-tuning, and how does it work?
Fine-tuning is a process of training a pre-trained language model on a new task or dataset. It's like fine-tuning a car to drive on a new road, but instead of driving, the model is learning to understand and generate human language.

Fine-tuning is done by adjusting the model's weights and parameters to fit the new task. This can be done using various techniques such as regularization, early stopping, and gradient descent. The goal is to minimize the difference between the model's output and the target output, which is often a list of labels or a specific output.

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. Pre-training: The model is initially trained on a large dataset using a pre-training objective such as masked language modeling or next sentence prediction.
2. Fine-tuning: The model is then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset using a fine-tuning objective such as classification or regression.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: The model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search or random search.

Fine-tuning can be done in various ways, including:

* Adapting the model's weights and parameters to fit the new task
* Using regularization techniques such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization
* Applying early stopping to prevent overfitting
* Using gradient descent with a learning rate schedule

Fine-tuning has many benefits, including improved performance on the new task, reduced training time, and improved generalization to unseen data. However, it can also be challenging and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters and regularization techniques.",0,,,"One paper published on fine-tuning in 2024 is ""Han et al 2024 - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Models: A Comprehensive Survey"".

Describe FOUL-UP.,NLP Wiki,"What is FOUL-UP?

FOUL-UP is a common phenomenon in language models and other NLP tasks where the model's performance is compromised due to various factors. It is a combination of several issues, including:

1. **Overfitting**: The model is too specialized to the training data, and its performance on new, unseen data is poor.
2. **Underfitting**: The model is too general and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data well.
3. **Noise**: The model is exposed to noise or errors in the training data, which can affect its performance.
4. **Lack of regularization**: The model is not regularized properly, leading to overfitting or underfitting.

When a model experiences FOUL-UP, its performance can be severely compromised, leading to suboptimal results. In some cases, it can even lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets previously learned knowledge or skills. Therefore, it is essential to identify and address these issues to improve the performance of language models and other NLP tasks.",,,,"""FOUL-UP is a technique used to improve the performance of large language models by adding a small amount of uniform noise to each weight matrix before fine-tuning. This technique has been shown to improve the performance of these models by reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting and improving the generalization ability of the model. By adding a small amount of noise, the model is forced to relearn the relationships between the input and output, which can lead to improved performance and robustness.

What is a lanuage model?,NLP Wiki,"A language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. It can understand and respond to natural language inputs, and can even learn from its interactions with users. Language models are typically used in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation systems. They can be used to create more conversational and engaging interfaces, and can also be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of language-based tasks.",,,,"""A language model is a probability distribution over sentences, that is, it assigns probabilities to sentences. It can usually compute the probability of the next word given a sequence of words, or the probability of a word given a surrounding context. Unlike traditional language models, masked language models can't be used to compute the probability of a sentence, and so they aren't really ""language models"" in the traditional sense. 

In essence, a language model is a statistical tool that can predict the likelihood of a word or sequence of words given a particular context. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including language generation, text classification, and machine translation. The language model can be trained on a large dataset of text, which enables it to learn patterns and relationships in the language. 

The language model can be classified into two main types: autoregressive language models and masked language models. Autoregressive language models are the traditional type of language model, which can be used to compute the probability of the next word given a sequence of words. Masked language models, on the other hand, are a type of language model that can only predict the probability of a word given a surrounding context.

I'd like more information on Logistic Regression.,NLP Wiki,"Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It is based on the concept of Bayes' theorem and assumes that the probability of a positive outcome is proportional to the product of the probability of the positive feature and the probability of the positive outcome given the feature.

In logistic regression, we have a set of features, one for each class or category, and a target variable that we want to predict. We then use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the positive outcome given each feature, and we multiply these probabilities together to get the final probability of the positive outcome.

The logistic regression model is trained on a dataset, and it learns to optimize the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data. The parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method, and the model is then used to make predictions on new data.

One of the key features of logistic regression is that it is a linear model, and it can be interpreted as a linear decision boundary. This makes it easy to visualize and understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.

However, logistic regression has some limitations. It assumes that the data is normally distributed, and it can be sensitive to outliers and non-normality. Additionally, it is a non-linear model, and it can be difficult to interpret the coefficients of the features.

Despite these limitations, logistic regression remains a widely used and effective algorithm for binary classification problems. It is particularly useful when the data is small or when there are many features to consider.

Here's an example of how logistic regression works:

Suppose we have a dataset of customers who have purchased a product or not. We want to predict whether a customer has purchased the product or not based on their age, income, and credit score.

The logistic regression model would work as follows:

1. We would use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the positive outcome (purchased) given each feature (age, income, credit score).
2. We would multiply these probabilities together to get the final probability of the positive outcome (purchased).
3. We would then use the model to make predictions on new data, such as a new customer who has purchased a product.

For example, let's say we have the following dataset:

| Age | Income | Credit Score | Purchased |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 25 | 50000 | 700 | 1 |
| 30 | 60000 | 800 | 0 |
| 35 | 70000 | 900 | 1 |
|... |... |... |... |

We would use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the positive outcome (purchased) given each feature, and then multiply these probabilities together to get the final probability of the positive outcome (purchased).

The final probability of the positive outcome (purchased) would be:

(0.4 x 0.7) + (0.3 x 0.8) + (0.2 x 0.9) = 0.31

This means that the probability of a customer purchasing a product is 31%.

Note that this is just one example of how logistic regression works, and there are many variations and modifications to the algorithm that can be used to solve different types of classification problems.",,,,"Logistic regression is a type of classification algorithm used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable. The algorithm is based on the idea that the probability of the dependent variable being in a particular category is proportional to the number of observations in that category. Logistic regression is commonly used in machine learning for binary classification problems. It is also known as logit regression or log-linear regression. The algorithm is based on the log-likelihood function and is often used in conjunction with regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Logistic regression is widely used in many fields, including medicine, finance, and marketing.

In the context of machine learning, logistic regression is often used for classification problems where the dependent variable is binary (0 or 1, yes or no, etc.). The algorithm works by modeling the probability of the dependent variable being in a particular category as a logistic function, which is a mathematical function that maps the input variables to a probability between 0 and 1. The logistic function is typically modeled using a linear equation, where the coefficients of the linear equation are learned during training.

Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm in machine learning due to its simplicity and effectiveness. It is often used in conjunction with other algorithms, such as decision trees and neural networks, to improve the accuracy of classification models. In addition, logistic regression can be used for regression problems, where the dependent variable is continuous, by using a linear equation and a non-linear transformation to model the relationship between the input variables and the dependent variable.

Overall, logistic regression is a powerful tool for classification and regression problems, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice for many machine learning applications.

"I'm not on campus, can I use the UC SHIP insurance for services outside of Santa Cruz?",Health Insurance,"Yes, you can use the UC SHIP insurance for services outside of Santa Cruz, but you must get a referral from the Student Health Center (SHC) to get care anywhere else — except for emergency room care, urgent care clinic visits, pediatric care, obstetrics services, gynecological care, and LiveHealth Online virtual visits.

You'll pay nothing for preventive care at the SHC, and low copays for other services and procedures. Except for preventive care, you will pay a deductible for services you receive outside the SHC or the UC network of doctors and facilities, unless otherwise noted. After you meet the deductible, the plan will pay a portion of the cost.

If you receive any care from an out-of-network provider, you will be responsible for your coinsurance plus any amount above the maximum allowable charges. You'll always pay more when you receive care from providers who are not part of the UC SHIP or Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer PPO networks.
